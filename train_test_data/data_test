The incident comes as U.S. presidential hopeful Barack Obama is visiting Afghanistan to find out how international efforts against extremist militants trying to overthrow the Afghan government are progressing.
There have been several deadly incidents of ""friendly fire"" in Afghanistan, where many local and international security forces are involved in a growing fight against Taliban insurgents.
Earlier this month a British helicopter mistakenly opened fire on a group of British soldiers in Helmand province, injuring nine of them, three seriously, the Defense Ministry said.

Its a sad day for all Quebecers and Canadians to see a terrorist attack happen in peaceful Quebec City, said Mohamed Yacoub, co-chairman of an Islamic community centre in a Montreal suburb.

Israeli media reported the deployment to be an unusual move, suggesting that in recent years, artillery battery have typically been deployed near Gaza ahead of escalating hostilities.
Earlier this month, a Gazan was killed and three seriously wounded when Israeli artillery bombarded an alleged ""terrorist cell"" east of Beit Lahiya in the northern Gaza Strip.
